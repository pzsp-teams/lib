# teams

```go
import "github.com/pzsp-teams/lib/teams"
```

Package teams provides team\-related operations and abstracts the underlying Microsoft Graph API calls.

The package exposes two interchangeable service implementations: one without cache and one with cache. When cache is enabled, the service stores and reuses team references \(e.g. display name \-\> team ID\), reducing the number of resolver/API calls. The cache may be cleared on request errors.

Concepts:

- teamRef is a team reference \(ID or display name\) used in method parameters.
- Operations are executed on behalf of the authenticated user \(derived from MSAL\); required scopes must be granted.
- Some operations accept a Graph patch object \(msmodels.Team\) for updates.
- Archived teams can be archived/unarchived via dedicated operations.
- Deleted teams can be restored using a deleted group ID.

If an async cached service is used, call Wait\(\) to ensure all background cache updates are finished.

## type [Service](<https://github.com/pzsp-teams/lib/blob/main/teams/service_interface.go#L25-L67>)

Service defines the interface for team\-related operations. It includes methods for retrieving, creating, updating, archiving, unarchiving, deleting, and restoring teams.

```go
type Service interface {
    // Get retrieves a specific team by its reference (ID or display name).
    Get(ctx context.Context, teamRef string) (*models.Team, error)

    // ListMyJoined returns all teams the authenticated user has joined.
    ListMyJoined(ctx context.Context) ([]*models.Team, error)

    // CreateViaGroup creates a new team associated with a Microsoft 365 group.
    CreateViaGroup(ctx context.Context, displayName, mailNickname, visibility string) (*models.Team, error)

    // CreateFromTemplate creates a new team from a template.
    CreateFromTemplate(ctx context.Context, displayName, description string, owners, members []string, visibility string, includeMe bool) (string, error)

    // Archive archives a team, optionally making SharePoint read-only for members.
    Archive(ctx context.Context, teamRef string, spoReadOnlyForMembers *bool) error

    // Unarchive restores an archived team.
    Unarchive(ctx context.Context, teamRef string) error

    // Delete removes a team.
    Delete(ctx context.Context, teamRef string) error

    // RestoreDeleted restores a deleted team using the deleted group ID.
    RestoreDeleted(ctx context.Context, deletedGroupID string) (string, error)

    // ListMembers returns all members of a team.
    ListMembers(ctx context.Context, teamRef string) ([]*models.Member, error)

    // GetMember retrieves a specific member of a team by their member ID or user email.
    GetMember(ctx context.Context, teamRef, userRef string) (*models.Member, error)

    // AddMember adds a new member to a team.
    AddMember(ctx context.Context, teamRef string, userRef string, isOwner bool) (*models.Member, error)

    // RemoveMember removes a member from a team by their member ID or user email.
    RemoveMember(ctx context.Context, teamRef, userRef string) error

    // UpdateMemberRoles updates the roles of a team member (e.g., promote to owner or demote to member).
    UpdateMemberRoles(ctx context.Context, teamRef, userRef string, isOwner bool) (*models.Member, error)

    // UpdateTeam applies updates to a team using the provided TeamUpdate object.
    UpdateTeam(ctx context.Context, teamRef string, update *models.TeamUpdate) (*models.Team, error)
}
```
